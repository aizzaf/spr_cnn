## Methodology 🛠️
This works consists of two part, training and testing. 

### Training 🔩
The training is a typical neural network workflow using Tensorflow.  
```cd training```

**start.sh**  
The first thing we must do is unzip the data and installing dependencies.  
```sh start.sh```  
This will generate 2 folders, image folder and metadata (csv) folder.  

**checking.ipynb**  
if you want to perform, id grouping go to this file.
